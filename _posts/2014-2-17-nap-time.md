# Nap Time

Lilypad Arduinos are awesome because they are wearable.  I bought one almost 8 months ago, but never ended up doing anything with it other than [build an RFDuino](http://kenhirakawa.com/one-way-rf-communication-with-arduino-and-node/).  To give it its due diligence (and not have it collect dust), I decided to build a simple eye mask with a built-in alarm.  After all, research has shown many times over that power naps can [boost productivity, creativity, well-being, learning, and much more](http://io9.com/the-science-behind-power-naps-and-why-theyre-so-damne-1401366016).  Here's how I did it.

The SnoozeMask is super simple.  When the microcontroller is powered on, it will start a 10 minute timer and the tri-color LED will start glowing green.  Once the timer finishes, it sends a signal to the Lilypad buzzer to vibrate, and thus wake you up.  To turn off the alarm, click the button board or simply turn off the Lilypad Arduino.  Simple!

## I Want One

Here's what you'll need.

1. Lilypad Arduino
2. Lilypad Buzzer
3. Lilypad Tri-color LED
4. Lilypad Button Board
5. LiPo Battery
6. Conductive threads and a needle
7. Nice, comfy eye mask

You can get all items everything except the eye mask by purchasing a [ProtoSnap Development Kit](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11261).  The eye mask I purchased can be found on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Dream-Zone--Earth-Therapeutics-Sleep/dp/B000JE2C9Y/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1383798238&sr=8-3&keywords=eyemask).

Assuming you have your [Arduino development environment set](http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage#.UwKTLEJdUzF), the first thing you'll want to do is install [Timer](http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/Timer#Installation) as an Arduino library.  Instalation instructions can be found [here](http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/Timer#Installation).  It's a simple timer utility library that our code will use to keep track of the time.

Next, grab the .ino source file [here](https://github.com/khirakawa/power-napper/blob/master/src/nap.ino) and upload it to your Lilypad.

Finally, wire your components like the following using something like banana clips.  You don't want to sew it yet, until you've confirmed that it works.

When you turn on your Lilypad you should immediately see the LED should glow green.  After 10 minutes the Buzzer should start to vibrate.

Once you know that it's working, start sewing your components onto your eye mask. Make sure to keep the conductive thread from touching each other, or you'll be left with a shorted circuit and a frown.

That's it. Now go take a nap!
